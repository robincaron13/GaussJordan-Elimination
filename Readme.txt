Solving System of Linear Equations: Gauss-Jordan Elimination Method can be used for finding the solution 
of a systems of linear equations which is applied throughout the mathematics.

Finding Determinant: The Gaussian Elimination can be applied to a square matrix in order to find determinant of the matrix.
Finding Inverse of Matrix: The Gauss-Jordan Elimination method can be used in determining the inverse of a square matrix.
Finding Ranks and Bases: Using reduced row echelon form, the ranks as well as bases of square matrices can be computed 
by Gaussian elimination method.
